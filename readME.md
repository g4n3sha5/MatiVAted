# MATIVATED
## Non-commercial pet project for Martial Artists
As numerous studies have shown, monitoring your progress and tracking your habits make us significantly more prone to improve our behaviour and progress faster. Small wins are massive motivators, but we need to recognize them. This project provides utilities for people who love sport - grappling Martial Arts, this app is specifically created for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.


# About
I created the project inspired by literature about habits and motivation, as Jiu-Jitsu is my passion and I didn't know any app for Jiu Jitsu I decided to create one - to save my Training Sessions, following this idea I did:

- Logo, name, colors and typography

- Landing page and general UI & UX design 

### And a set of small apps serving as tools for Martial Arts students:
#### Clubs
- Add / edit club
- Club Members (others' profiles, and permissions manager for authorized)
- Club Schedule (generator)
- Club Training Sessions (more info in About)
- Clubs List, where all users of MATIVATED can see every Club created, and ask (Request) authorized members of the Club to join it (permissions)

#### BJJorunal (Brazilian Jiu - Jitsu Journal)
- Dashboard (Statistics)
- Add Training Session (Save Session type, length, techniques learned etc.)
- Your Training Sessions (list of every TS, where user can edit or remove every Session)
- Open Techniques base (where every user can add a Jiu Jitsu Technique (name, type etc.) and add Suggestions to other Techniques)
- Simple To Do app where user can add a To Do list, and items to do for each list.

#### Notifications
- Notify authorized members about Requests 

#### Account / Profile
- Manage Account (change password / e-mail) and Profile (personal info (optional) - user's avatar, belt, bio, favourite technique and favourite grappler).

#### additional: About and Privacy policy
As the application processes some personal data, there is information how and what does it do.
